I’m debugging a problem with an Android WebView client that loads http://tvcon.trinity.local/control. 
The site works fine in a browser (Chrome/Silk) but not inside the WebView — the media list and other dynamic data fail to load.

That means my backend needs to be updated to allow full cookie + CORS support for local HTTP requests from Android WebView clients.

Please modify my backend server configuration accordingly:

1. Enable **CORS** for http://tvcon.trinity.local (and optionally localhost) with credentials support.
   - Include these headers in every response:
       Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://tvcon.trinity.local
       Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
       Vary: Origin
   - Also include Access-Control-Allow-Methods and Access-Control-Allow-Headers if needed.

2. Fix cookie handling:
   - When setting cookies (like session IDs or JWTs), use:
         SameSite=Lax
         Secure=False
   - Never set `SameSite=None; Secure` when using plain HTTP — WebView will reject them.
   - Always send cookies in API responses and accept them in requests.

3. If the backend is **Express.js**, update it to:
       import cors from "cors";
       app.use(cors({
         origin: "http://tvcon.trinity.local",
         credentials: true
       }));
       app.use((req, res, next) => {
         res.header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "http://tvcon.trinity.local");
         res.header("Access-Control-Allow-Credentials", "true");
         next();
       });

   When setting cookies in Express:
       res.cookie("sessionid", value, {
         httpOnly: true,
         secure: false,
         sameSite: "lax"
       });

4. If the backend is **Flask**, update it to:
       from flask_cors import CORS
       app = Flask(__name__)
       CORS(app, supports_credentials=True, origins=["http://tvcon.trinity.local"])

   And when setting cookies:
       response.set_cookie("sessionid", value, samesite="Lax", secure=False)

5. Restart the backend and verify that `/api/media` or equivalent now returns data when called from WebView with credentials.

After applying these changes, explain briefly how this fixes the WebView issue (cookies + CORS on LAN HTTP) and provide the final updated backend code block.
